# Location-Based-Chatroom
Join a chatroom within a specified radius or create a new one!


Make sure to enable location in Xcode! (While in Simulator: Features -> Location -> Custom)

<h1>Create a new Chatroom</h1>
Make a new chatroom for studying or just hanging out. Set the radius as large as you would like. Maybe you want more people to be able to see the room so go big. Perhaps you just want it to be small for a study group. The choice is yours!

<h1>Send messages with others</h1>
After you join a chatroom, start connecting with others. Share about how you think you did on an exam or maybe just have a relaxing conversation with people.

All messages were stored using Firebase and chatnames/profile settings were kept with Swift's Core Data.
